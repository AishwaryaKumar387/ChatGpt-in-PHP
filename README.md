### dTemperature means randomness of result. (Range 0-1)
### max_tokens means no. of words or stringor tokens in the output (Max is 2400)
- In the context of the OpenAI GPT-based language models such as ChatGPT, temperature and max_tokens are two important parameters that control the behavior of the language model when generating text.

Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the "creativity" or "diversity" of the generated text. It is a scaling factor applied to the logits (i.e., the raw outputs) of the language model before sampling the next token. A higher temperature value will result in more varied and creative text, while a lower temperature value will result in more conservative and predictable text. 

Max_tokens is another hyperparameter that controls the maximum length of the generated text. It specifies the maximum number of tokens (i.e., words, punctuation marks, etc.) that the model should generate before stopping. This is useful for controlling the length of the generated text and avoiding excessively long or irrelevant responses. For example, a max_tokens value of 50 means that the generated response should contain no more than 50 tokens.

### top_p means nucleus sampluing of result.
- top_p, also known as nucleus sampling or probabilistic sampling, is a technique used in language generation models such as GPT-2 and GPT-3 to control the diversity of generated outputs.

### frequency_penalty
- When the frequency_penalty parameter is set to 0, it means that the language model will not be penalized for repeating similar phrases or words in the generated text. This means that the model may generate text that contains repeated or similar phrases or words, if they are present in the input prompt or training data.

In other words, setting frequency_penalty to 0 allows the model to generate text that may contain repetition, which can be useful in some cases where repetition is acceptable or desirable. However, if you want to avoid excessive repetition in the generated text, you can set a non-zero value for the frequency_penalty parameter, which will penalize the model for repeating similar phrases or words too often.

### presence_penalty
- In the context of OpenAI's GPT-based language models, presence_penalty is a parameter that can be used to control the presence or absence of certain words or phrases in the generated text.

When generating text, the model tends to generate text that is relevant to the input prompt or training data. However, in some cases, you may want to ensure that certain words or phrases are either present or absent in the generated text. The presence_penalty parameter allows you to penalize the model for generating text that either contains or does not contain certain words or phrases, depending on your needs.

For example, if you want to ensure that the generated text contains a certain keyword or phrase, you can set a non-zero value for presence_penalty, which will penalize the model for generating text that does not contain that keyword or phrase. On the other hand, if you want to ensure that the generated text does not contain a certain keyword or phrase, you can set a negative value for presence_penalty, which will penalize the model for generating text that contains that keyword or phrase.

The presence_penalty parameter is usually set to a value between -1 and 1, with 0 meaning no penalty for presence or absence of certain words or phrases, and positive or negative values representing penalties for presence or absence respectively.

###  'stop' => '[" Human:", " AI:"]'
- In this context, 'stop' => '[" Human:", " AI:"]' is likely a configuration parameter that specifies the list of phrases or keywords that indicate the end of a turn for either the human or the AI participant in a conversation.

The example suggests that the chatbot is programmed to engage in a conversation with a human, and the strings " Human:" and " AI:" are used to denote the start of a new turn for either the human or the AI. When the chatbot receives one of these strings as input, it knows that it is the other participant's turn to speak, and it should stop generating text until it receives input from the other participant.

For example, if the chatbot generated the following text: "Hello, how can I assist you today?" and then received the string " Human:", it would stop generating text and wait for the human to respond before continuing the conversation. Conversely, if the chatbot received the string " AI:" after the human responded, it would generate its next response to continue the conversation.

### sModel
- In the code you provided, sModel refers to the name or identifier of the OpenAI GPT-based language model that is being used for the text generation. Specifically, in this case, the sModel variable is set to "text-davinci-003", which is the identifier for the OpenAI's GPT-3 language model called "Davinci" with a certain size and configuration.

The choice of the language model can have a significant impact on the quality and style of the generated text, as different models may have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the training data and architecture. In this example, the "text-davinci-003" model is one of the most advanced and capable models offered by OpenAI, with a large number of parameters and pre-training on a diverse range of text data.

Note that in order to use the OpenAI API and access the "text-davinci-003" model, you would need to provide a valid OPENAI_API_KEY as well.
